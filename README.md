## What is a Colada?
According to Wikipedia's [Cuban Coffee Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_espresso)
> Colada is 3â€“6 shots of Cuban-style espresso served in a Styrofoam cup along with small, plastic demitasses. 
> It is a takeaway form, meant to be shared. This is customary of workplace breaks in Cuban communities.[14][15]

For us, it started with the dev team after we made a trip to Miami. We now have colada drinkers in all parts of 
the company and it has been a great way to socialize across teams.
